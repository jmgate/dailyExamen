# Daily Examen

Before you begin, as in all prayer, remind yourself that you're in God's
presence, and ask God to help you with your prayer.

1. **Gratitude:**  Recall anything from the day for which you are especially
   grateful, and give thanks.
1. **Review:**  Recall the events of the day, from start to finish, noticing
   where you felt God's presence, and where you accepted or turned away from
   any invitations to grow in love.
1. **Sorrow:**  Recall any actions for which you are sorry.
1. **Forgiveness:**  Ask for God's forgiveness. Decide whether you want to
   reconcile with anyone you have hurt.
1. **Grace:**  Ask God for the grace you need for the next day and an ability
   to see God's presence more clearly.

## Evening

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm grateful that Lily maintained a good attitude for most
   of the day.  I'm grateful that Ben's such a little bundle of joy.  I'm
   grateful for having decided on a name for littlest one&mdash;Joshua
   Nathanael.  Thank you God for all these things.

1. **Review:**
   * Git notes
   * CCR-U meeting
   * Jenkins job fixes
   * Dinner
   * Painting

1. **Sorrow:**  

1. **Forgiveness:**  

1. **Grace:**  God help me to see your presence more clearly.

## Mid-Day

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm grateful Lily was able to finish her chore.  Thank you
   God.  I'm grateful Matt and I are on the same page with respect to EMPIRE's
   needs.

1. **Review:**
   * Lily happy at breakfast
   * Continued rebellion; removed everything from her room:  Probably could've
     been more loving here.  Tried awful hard at least.
   * Git notes
   * Meeting with Ross and Joe:  Easy to get frustrated rather than see things
     from another perspective.
   * Meeting with Matt

1. **Sorrow:**  I'm sorry for Hulk-roaring in frustration.  It wasn't actually
   at Lily, but It'd be good to get to a point where I don't go that far.

1. **Forgiveness:**  God forgive me for my anger and frustration.

1. **Grace:**  God give me grace to finish the day better than I started it.

# Wednesday, April 4, 2018

## Evening

1. **Gratitude:**  Thank you God for the freedom to come home during the day
   and work from home.  Thank you that the painting is going well so far, and
   that Benjamin's about the cutest little thing ever.

1. **Review:**
   * Department Meeting
   * Git materials:  I could stand to appreciate my fellow instructors more.
   * Chat with Marcia
   * Dealing with Lily's refusal to obey:  Thank you for the grace to deal with
     this with minimal anger.
   * Painting

1. **Sorrow:**  I might be sorry about pinning Lily to the wall to make sure
   she was listening to me.  Not sure though.  I didn't hurt her, but at the
   same time I really don't want to be doing things like that on a regular
   basis.

1. **Forgiveness:**  God, please forgive me for my shortness with Lily.
   Forgive me for my unkind thoughts regarding Hannah's broken phone.  Help me
   to view things in their proper place, keeping in mind eternal, rather than
   temporal/material, significance.

1. **Grace:**  God give us grace and wisdom in dealing with Lily's current
   rebellion.  Give me grace to accept Hannah's apology regarding the phone.

## Mid-Day

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm grateful for some good sleep and that the kids slept in
   a bit.  I'm grateful that I figured out the workaround to get these EMPIRE
   tests up and running.  Thank you God.

1. **Review:**
   * Lectio Divina
   * Homeletics prep
   * Breakfast
   * Commute
   * Chat with Mitch
   * Charon meeting:  I could stand to grow in love toward Trilinos developers
     that tend to aggravate me.
   * Chat with Larry about beekeeping:  This seems worth pursuing, a connection
     to Larry outside work.
   * EMPIRE/Jenkins
   * Chat with Steven about smoking ribs

1. **Sorrow:**  I'm sorry for my attitude toward coworkers who frustrate me.

1. **Forgiveness:**  God, forgive me for my poor attitude.  Help me to see
   them, their decisions, and actions in a better light.  Help me to see the
   benefit they provide.

1. **Grace:**  God, give me the grace to finish the day with a better
   viewpoint.

## Evening

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm grateful for the chance to spend time with Lily and Ben

   making progress on both the picnic table and kids room.  Thank you God.

1. **Review:**
   * Lectio Divina
   * Leaving for work
   * Git class
   * Drekar meeting

   I don't think I necessarily felt God's presence today, nor do I think I
   accepted or turned away from invitations to grow in love.

1. **Sorrow:**  I'm sorry for pounding on the table to get Lily's attention
   yesterday.  I need to find another way to ensure she listens immediately, or
   rethink the need for her to listen immediately.

1. **Forgiveness:**  God, forgive me for my shortness of temper with the kids.

1. **Grace:**  God, give me grace for tomorrow, that I would walk through it
   more intentionally than today.  Help me to see where you're at work around
   me.
