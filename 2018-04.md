# Daily Examen

Before you begin, as in all prayer, remind yourself that you're in God's
presence, and ask God to help you with your prayer.

1. **Gratitude:**  Recall anything from the day for which you are especially
   grateful, and give thanks.
1. **Review:**  Recall the events of the day, from start to finish, noticing
   where you felt God's presence, and where you accepted or turned away from
   any invitations to grow in love.
1. **Sorrow:**  Recall any actions for which you are sorry.
1. **Forgiveness:**  Ask for God's forgiveness. Decide whether you want to
   reconcile with anyone you have hurt.
1. **Grace:**  Ask God for the grace you need for the next day and an ability
   to see God's presence more clearly.

## Evening

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm grateful for the chance to spend time with Lily and Ben
   at the park while Hannah was at physical therapy.  I'm grateful that we're
   making progress on both the picnic table and kids room.  Thank you God.

1. **Review:**
   * Lectio Divina
   * Leaving for work
   * Git class
   * Drekar meeting
   * Chat with Mitch
   * Chat with Steven
   * Chat with Allen
   * EMPIRE meeting
   * EMPIRE work
   * Sanding
   * Dinner
   * Lawn mowing
   * Sanding
   * Chat with Hannah

   I don't think I necessarily felt God's presence today, nor do I think I
   accepted or turned away from invitations to grow in love.

1. **Sorrow:**  I'm sorry for pounding on the table to get Lily's attention
   yesterday.  I need to find another way to ensure she listens immediately, or
   rethink the need for her to listen immediately.

1. **Forgiveness:**  God, forgive me for my shortness of temper with the kids.

1. **Grace:**  God, give me grace for tomorrow, that I would walk through it
   more intentionally than today.  Help me to see where you're at work around
   me.

## Mid-Day

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm grateful for some good sleep and that the kids slept in
   a bit.  I'm grateful that I figured out the workaround to get these EMPIRE
   tests up and running.  Thank you God.

1. **Review:**
   * Lectio Divina
   * Homeletics prep
   * Breakfast
   * Commute
   * Chat with Mitch
   * Charon meeting:  I could stand to grow in love toward Trilinos developers
     that tend to aggravate me.
   * Chat with Larry about beekeeping:  This seems worth pursuing, a connection
     to Larry outside work.
   * EMPIRE/Jenkins
   * Chat with Steven about smoking ribs

1. **Sorrow:**  I'm sorry for my attitude toward coworkers who frustrate me.

1. **Forgiveness:**  God, forgive me for my poor attitude.  Help me to see
   them, their decisions, and actions in a better light.  Help me to see the
   benefit they provide.

1. **Grace:**  God, give me the grace to finish the day with a better
   viewpoint.
