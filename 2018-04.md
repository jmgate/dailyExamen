# Daily Examen

Before you begin, as in all prayer, remind yourself that you're in God's
presence, and ask God to help you with your prayer.

1. **Gratitude:**  Recall anything from the day for which you are especially
   grateful, and give thanks.
1. **Review:**  Recall the events of the day, from start to finish, noticing
   where you felt God's presence, and where you accepted or turned away from
   any invitations to grow in love.
1. **Sorrow:**  Recall any actions for which you are sorry.
1. **Forgiveness:**  Ask for God's forgiveness. Decide whether you want to
   reconcile with anyone you have hurt.
1. **Grace:**  Ask God for the grace you need for the next day and an ability
   to see God's presence more clearly.

## Evening

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm grateful for the chance to spend time with Lily and Ben at the park
   while Hannah was at physical therapy.  I'm grateful that we're making
   progress on both the picnic table and kids room.  Thank you God.

1. **Review:**
   * Lectio Divina
   * Leaving for work
   * Git class
   * Drekar meeting
   * Chat with Mitch
   * Chat with Steven
   * Chat with Allen
   * EMPIRE meeting
   * EMPIRE work
   * Sanding
   * Dinner
   * Lawn mowing
   * Sanding
   * Chat with Hannah

   I don't think I necessarily felt God's presence today, nor do I think I
   accepted or turned away from invitations to grow in love.

1. **Sorrow:**  I'm sorry for pounding on the table to get Lily's attention yesterday.  I
   need to find another way to ensure she listens immediately, or rethink the
   need for her to listen immediately.

1. **Forgiveness:**  God, forgive me for my shortness of temper with the kids.

1. **Grace:**  God, give me grace for tomorrow, that I would walk through it more
   intentionally than today.  Help me to see where you're at work around me.
