# Daily Examen

Before you begin, as in all prayer, remind yourself that you're in God's
presence, and ask God to help you with your prayer.

1. **Gratitude:**  Recall anything from the day for which you are especially
   grateful, and give thanks.
1. **Review:**  Recall the events of the day, from start to finish, noticing
   where you felt God's presence, and where you accepted or turned away from
   any invitations to grow in love.
1. **Sorrow:**  Recall any actions for which you are sorry.
1. **Forgiveness:**  Ask for God's forgiveness. Decide whether you want to
   reconcile with anyone you have hurt.
1. **Grace:**  Ask God for the grace you need for the next day and an ability
   to see God's presence more clearly.
