# Daily Examen

Before you begin, as in all prayer, remind yourself that you're in God's
presence, and ask God to help you with your prayer.

1. **Gratitude:**  Recall anything from the day for which you are especially
   grateful, and give thanks.
1. **Review:**  Recall the events of the day, from start to finish, noticing
   where you felt God's presence, and where you accepted or turned away from
   any invitations to grow in love.
1. **Sorrow:**  Recall any actions for which you are sorry.
1. **Forgiveness:**  Ask for God's forgiveness. Decide whether you want to
   reconcile with anyone you have hurt.
1. **Grace:**  Ask God for the grace you need for the next day and an ability
   to see God's presence more clearly.

## Mid-Day

1. **Gratitude:**  I'm especially grateful to have had nothing scheduled this
   morning.
1. **Review:**
   * Early morning; minimal sleep&mdash;need to just wake up and get going.
   * Good breakfast time with the family.
   * Git registrations&mdash;encouraging to see the level of interest.
   * Charon/Teko/Thyra work&mdash;really easy to hate my job.
   * EMPIRE CONTRIBUTING.md&mdash;good to be productive, even in small things.
1. **Sorrow:**  I'm sorry that I'm not losing weight.  I want to be healthier,
   but stress-eating is a significant temptation.
1. **Forgiveness:**  God, forgive me for my bad attitude toward my job.  Help
   me focus on the good and give me patience with improving the bad.
1. **Grace:**  God, please give me the grace to make it through the rest of the
   day with a good attitude, and help the kids and I get through the evening
   without any trouble.
